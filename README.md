# Drug Reaction checker and statistical analysis of usefulness of drugs

The project consists of two interconnected parts .The first part consists of statistical analysis of the dataset "final.csv" present in the repository and finding out the usefulness of each drug by performing regression and sentimental analysis (classical statistical techniques).We then take input from the user as to which condition he/she is suffering from and give output in the form of 5 best drugs for that condition.
The second part of the project includes a drug reaction checking site which will take input from the user as to which drugs he is taking and return the detrimental reactions that can take place .The data has been taken from "https://go.drugbank.com/drug-interaction-checker".
